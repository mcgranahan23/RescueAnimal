Overview

Grazioso Salvare currently uses dogs as search and rescue animals. They expect to begin training
monkeys as search and rescue animals as well. In current operations, dogs are given the status
of “intake” before training starts. Once in training, their status can change to one of five phases:
Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, Phase IV, and Phase V. When a dog graduates from training, it is given
the status of “in-service” and is considered a Rescue Animal. If a dog does not successfully make
it through training, it is given the status of “farm,” indicating that it will live a life of leisure on a
Grazioso Salvare farm.

The Animals

Currently when Grazioso Salvare acquires a dog, they record the name, breed, gender, age, and
weight. Grazioso Salvare also records the date and the location where they acquired the dog.
Additionally, they track the training status of the dog, as described above. When a dog is “in-
service”, they record the country where the dog is in service and whether or not the dog is
“reserved”.
